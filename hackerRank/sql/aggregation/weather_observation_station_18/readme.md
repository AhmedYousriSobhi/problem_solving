Class: Medium

Source: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-18/problem?isFullScreen=true

## Description
Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d)to be two points on a 2D plane.

- a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
- c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:
